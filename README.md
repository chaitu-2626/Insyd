# Insyd: A Real-Time Social Application

Insyd is a modern social application designed to provide a seamless and interactive user experience with real-time features. It leverages a robust tech stack to ensure efficient data handling, secure authentication, and scalable real-time communication.

## üöÄ Features

*   **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication powered by Clerk.
*   **Real-Time Interactions:** Instant updates and notifications via Socket.IO.
*   **Content Persistence:** Structured data storage using Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL.
*   **Scalable Notification System:** Asynchronous, reliable notification delivery with a worker queue (Redis/Kafka).
*   **Offline Notification Delivery:** Users receive missed notifications upon coming online.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Caching strategies for online user presence and notification reads.

## üß† Architecture and Tech Stack

The application is built with a full-stack approach, integrating various technologies to deliver a responsive and scalable platform.

### Overall User and Tech Stack Flow (Diagram 1 Context)

*   **Frontend:** Developed with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, providing a dynamic and type-safe user interface. It connects to the backend via Socket.IO, authenticating with a Clerk session token.
*   **Authentication:** **Clerk** handles all user authentication processes. Backend verifies Clerk tokens to ensure only authenticated users establish socket connections.
*   **Backend:** Built with **Express.js** and **TypeScript**, managing API endpoints and real-time communication through Socket.IO.
*   **Database Layer:** **Drizzle ORM** is used for efficient and type-safe interaction with **PostgreSQL** for persistent data storage.

### Real-Time Notification System

#### Basic Notification System (Diagram 2 Context)

This initial design focuses on immediate, socket-based notifications. When an action (e.g., a follow) is triggered by User B, the backend authenticates the request, stores the event in the database, and if User A is online, emits a toast notification directly to their socket ID.

**Limitations of Basic System:**
*   **Not Scalable for Large User Bases:** In-memory socket mappings become unreliable across multiple server instances.
*   **No Retry Mechanism:** Notifications can be lost if the socket is momentarily disconnected.
*   **No Persistence for Missed Notifications:** Offline users do not receive notifications.

#### Scalable Notification System (Diagram 3 Context)

To address the limitations of the basic system, a scalable approach introduces asynchronous queuing and workers for reliable notification delivery.

**Flow Summary:**
1.  **Step 1:** The backend saves the action (e.g., follow) into the PostgreSQL database using Drizzle.
2.  **Step 2:** Upon successful database persistence, a notification job is added to a **Redis/Kafka queue**.
3.  **Worker:** A dedicated background service consumes jobs from the queue.
    *   If the recipient user is online, a real-time socket notification is emitted.
    *   If the user is offline, the notification is stored in the database or cache for later retrieval.
4.  **Dashboard/API:** Users can retrieve historical notifications, ensuring no notifications are missed, even if they were offline.

**Improvements in Scalability:**
*   **Decoupled Logic:** Notification logic is separated from the API route using queues and workers, improving responsiveness.
*   **Reliable Delivery:** Events are persisted and retried if needed, ensuring no missed notifications.
*   **Distributable:** Workers can be scaled horizontally to handle increased load.

## ‚ö° Caching for Performance Optimization

Caching is strategically implemented to enhance application performance and scalability.

*   **Online User Presence:** Online users are stored in **Redis** instead of in-memory maps, enabling horizontal scaling with Redis pub/sub or Socket.IO Redis adapter.
*   **Notification Reads:** Responses for the `/notifications` endpoint (including read/unread status) are cached using **Redis** or an **In-Memory LRU cache**.
*   **Job Deduplication:** **Redis** is used for idempotent job keys to prevent duplicate notifications from being processed.

## üí° Potential Enhancements

*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement `express-rate-limit` middleware for APIs to prevent abuse.
*   **Input Validation:** Utilize `zod` for secure, type-safe data handling at all endpoints.
*   **Socket.IO Authentication:** Improve long-lived sessions using refresh tokens for Socket.IO authentication.
